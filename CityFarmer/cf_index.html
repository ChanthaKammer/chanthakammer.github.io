			<li>Make city farmer friends in your area. Every climate and growing season is different.  Learning what specific herbs or vegetables work well in your area is essential to success.</li>
			<li>Start small.  Pick a couple of things that are easy and reliable as starters.</li>
			<li>Use good soil.  Healthy plants cannot grow without it.  You may need to add compost, nitrogen, or phosphorus. Again, the veterans in your area can help you develop good soil.</li>
			<li>Plants need sunlight.  Generally vegetables can use as much sunlight as possible, but some leafy greens will do well in shaded areas too.</li>
			<li>Plants need water.  It's hard to overwater vegetables, but each plant tolerates variations in moisture differently.  Generally, a little water often is your best bet.</li>
			<li>Keep the weeds out.  Weeds waste valuable space, moisture and nutrients. Weeding your garden also gives you the chance to study your crop and make adjustments.</li>
