Decided to cut my losses with this one. Trying to write the code by myself proved too difficult for me. Better to get some points rather than none.
I assume there are some problems with styles from materialize being interrupted by my css. My imposter syndrome is getting pretty bad, I don't want to suffer any longer
this weekend, didn't sleep much last night because of it. Spending time in tutoring helped me a lot last semester, so when a tutor becomes available for 
this class I will be taking advantage of that. On a happier note I have clips from my favorite videogames that I will add to my gallery, it was nice going down memory lane.
Going to be working on this a lot this week, also going to cut down on my job hours.
